# 30-Days-of-SQL-Analytics-with-AdventureWorks-2019
This repository documents a structured 30 day SQL challenge built on the AdventureWorks 2019 dataset. The goal of the challenge was to move from foundational SQL syntax to advanced analytical querying, while developing consistency, clarity, and real world problem solving skills.

Rather than isolated practice queries, this project represents a complete learning journey. Each day builds on the previous one, progressing from basic data retrieval to complex analytical patterns commonly used in production environments.

Dataset

AdventureWorks 2019 is a realistic enterprise dataset that mirrors sales, customers, products, and operational data. It provides a strong foundation for practicing business driven SQL analysis.

What This Project Covers

Over 30 days, the work systematically explores SQL from fundamentals to advanced analytics.

Core SQL operations including SELECT, filtering, sorting, and handling NULL values

Data manipulation using INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE

Working with strings, numbers, and dates for practical data preparation

Comprehensive filtering techniques such as LIKE, BETWEEN, IN, and logical conditions

Single table and multi table joins including INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, and SELF joins

Aggregation and grouping using COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, and HAVING

Subqueries both simple and correlated for nested logic

Common Table Expressions for readable and maintainable query design

Window functions such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, LEAD, and LAG

Running totals and moving averages for analytical reporting

Advanced topics including views, transactions, constraints, stored procedures, and triggers

Query optimization concepts and execution plan awareness

Analytics focused SQL for data cleaning, transformation, time series analysis, and exploratory analysis

Mini projects and a final capstone project simulating real business reporting scenarios

How to Navigate the SQL Script

All queries are contained in a single SQL script and organized by day using clear and descriptive comments. Each section can be read independently, making it easy to follow the progression or focus on specific concepts.

What This Demonstrates

This project demonstrates more than SQL syntax. It reflects analytical thinking, structured learning, and the ability to translate business questions into clear, efficient queries. Emphasis is placed on readability, logical flow, and practical application rather than memorization.

Key Takeaway

Consistency compounds. Writing SQL every day across increasingly complex scenarios builds not just technical skill, but confidence and clarity in approaching real world data problems.
